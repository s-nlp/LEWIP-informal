# Dataset for evaluating content presevinf formality transfer

The dataset is based on [SGDD-TST](https://github.com/s-nlp/SGDD-TST/tree/master/dataset) - a dataset of sentence pairs in a formal and informal style with human annotation of semantic similarity. The original texts (first sentence of the pair) were collected from [SGDD (Schema-Guided Dialogue Dataset)](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/dstc8-schema-guided-dialogue) which contains task-oriented dialogues naturally full of named entities related to real-life tasks (booking of hotels, flights, restaurants). The slots of such entities are explicitly annotated in SGDD. The informal paraphrases (second sentence from pair) were generated by a T5-based model fin-tuned on GYAFC - a parallel dataset of formality transfer.

The file consists of the following columns

source_text - informal text from SGDD
important_entities - list of important slots obtained ffrom SGDD (can be empty)
informal_paraphrase - informal paraphrase either generated by the large model pretrained on paralle data
source_text_inform_score - informality score of source sentence by [roberta-base-formality-ranker](https://huggingface.co/SkolkovoInstitute/roberta-base-formality-ranker) or written manually by our team members 
informal_paraphrase_inform_score - informality score of the generated sentence by [roberta-base-formality-ranker](https://huggingface.co/SkolkovoInstitute/roberta-base-formality-ranker)
informal_increase - increase of informality score
is_manual_rewrite - whether the informal rewrite was written manually (1 means manual)
